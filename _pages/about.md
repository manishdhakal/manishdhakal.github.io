<b>Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing</b>

Hello, I'm Manish Dhakal, a <b> PhD Student</b> at Georgia State University, under the supervision of <a href="https://ding1.com"> Dr. Yi Ding</a> and <a href="https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/raj-sunderraman"> Dr. Raj Sunderraman</a>. I am working as a <b> Graduate Research Assistant (GRA)</b> for computer science department, specializing in the applications of <b>artificial intelligence and deep learning</b> for computer vision and natural language processing research.

My desire to contribute to these sectors and investigate cutting-edge solutions is motivated by a sincere curiosity. I'm pursuing to further my knowledge and give back to the ML/AI community.
